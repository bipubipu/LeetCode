## Prelude
My current state is like standing at the bottom of a pit. I am a career changer and haven't settled down for a job yet and COVID-19 came.

I keep myself busy to forget about the financial crisis that I am having for the moment. One thing that returns to my routine is programming, about which I have certain amount of foundation.    

Time flies when I am immersed in programming. I can spend hours finding bugs and analysing others' solutions. I feel very content after solving one challenge after another. In this virtual world, I gained a sense of control. I'm like a general who only gives commands and the computer will follow my order and present exactly what I want. 

Programming is like a beacon that lights up my way,a ladder for me to climb out of the pit, and a pair of wings which can take me wherever I want to go. 

There are so many brilliant questions and solutions that I can't help noting them down. This repo will function as a record of my journey in LeetCode.
